This folder contains notes about Windows configuration commands and files.

The documentation is divided into two types of notes:

- **Service configurations** (SSH, DHCP, DNS, etc.):  
    These notes explain the steps and required settings needed to properly install and configure each service so that it works correctly.
- **Configuration files**:  
    These notes collect and explain the available options and directives found in configuration files, describing what each option does and how it affects the system.
